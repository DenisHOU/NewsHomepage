This is a challenge of level "Junior" from the site FrontendMentor. This is a responsive news home page using HTML, CSS and JS.

Problems I encountered : 
-Make a transition for the accordion while on a mobile screen when we click the menu button at the top right corner.

Things I learned :
-Usage of CSS Grid.
-The accordion style for a navigation section.
